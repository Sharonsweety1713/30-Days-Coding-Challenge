//You have 2 paintings of size a x b and c x d. You want to hang the paintings inside a rectangular board on the wall.
//The board has dimensions n x m. You are allowed to rotate the paintings but at least one edge of each of the paintings must be parallel to an edge of the board. 
//The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board but cannot overlap or go beyond the edge of the board.
